          <strong>Dear Hiring Manager,</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            I'm writing to express my strong interest in a Software Engineer
            position at your company. With a solid academic foundation in both
            Computer Science (Western Governors University) and Economics
            (University of Texas at Tyler), paired with hands-on experience in
            software development and AI data annotation, I bring a blend of
            analytical rigor and practical coding expertise that aligns well
            with your team's goals.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Most recently, I have worked as an AI Data Annotator, where I
            reviewed and fact-checked <em>over 1,600</em> LLM responses using
            languages such as <mark>Python, JavaScript, SQL, and Java</mark>. In
            this role, I was consistently trusted to assess the quality of other
            annotators' code and factuality ratingsâ€”responsibilities that
            demanded both precision and a deep understanding of technical
            content. This experience sharpened my ability to write clean,
            testable code and critically evaluate code logic at scale.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Beyond annotation, I've developed full-stack applications such as a
            real-time stock trading web platform using Python, Flask,
            JavaScript, and SQLite, emphasizing RESTful API design and secure
            authentication. I've also built a DOM-driven Etch-A-Sketch tool to
            reinforce front-end skills in JavaScript and CSS. These projects
            reflect my capacity to own software from ideation through
            implementation. This has deepened my appreciate of the
            famous quote &mdash; "Computer science is no more about computers
            than astronomy is about telescopes." (Johnson, 2011, pp. 81-82) Computers are merely the tools
            that allow us to carry out our ideas.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I'm excited about the opportunity to grow as a developer and
            contribute to innovative, user-focused software. I would welcome the
            chance to discuss how my skills and experience could be a match for
            your engineering team.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
